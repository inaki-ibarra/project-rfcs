## Overview

A specification for a utensil that can be used for eating solid or liquid-based foods.

## Objective

To enjoy a meal without touching it and reduce hand injuries caused by burns.

## Motivation

Eating food with your bare hands can contaminate it or cause burns when it's hot.
One day, I tried gulping a soup right way and immediately regret my decision.

## Detailed Design

A 'spoon' (sp≈çn) is a small shallow bowl connected to a handle. The shallow portion (head) is small enough to fit in user's mouth. It is made of wood and weights 25 grams, reusable after washing. Using it is easy, first the user hold the handle horizontally with your dominant hand. Slowly, dip it downwards into your food until you have enough then bring the spoon to your mouth so you can eat the food. Never eat the spoon.

## Drawbacks

- Balancing the food on top of the head takes practice.
- More work for dishwashers if we assume 1 spoon is-to 1 person ratio.

## Alternatives

- Make sure that the food is cold enough when using hands.
- Use chopsticks but will only cater to solid foods.
- Use gloves to protect hands.
